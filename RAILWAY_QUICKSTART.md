# ðŸš‚ Railway Deployment - Quick Start

Your StudyFlow app is **100% ready** for Railway deployment!

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Push to GitHub
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for Railway deployment"
git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Railway

1. **Go to Railway:** https://railway.app
2. **Click "New Project"**
3. **Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. **Choose your repository**

### 3. Add PostgreSQL Database

1. In your Railway project dashboard, click **"New"**
2. Select **"Database" â†’ "Add PostgreSQL"**
3. Railway automatically sets `DATABASE_URL` âœ…

### 4. Set Environment Variables

In your service settings, go to **"Variables"** tab and add:

```
NODE_ENV=production
SESSION_SECRET=<click "Generate" button>
```

That's it! Railway will automatically:
- âœ… Build your app using the config in `railway.json`
- âœ… Run database migrations (`npm run db:push`)
- âœ… Start your server (`npm start`)
- âœ… Assign a public URL

## What's Already Configured

âœ… **railway.json** - Build and deploy settings
âœ… **Database migrations** - Runs automatically during build
âœ… **PORT configuration** - Uses Railway's PORT environment variable
âœ… **Session storage** - PostgreSQL-backed sessions
âœ… **Production build** - Optimized Vite + esbuild bundle

## Verify Deployment

After deployment:
1. Visit your Railway URL
2. Create an account
3. Test all features (habits, todos, exams, grades)
