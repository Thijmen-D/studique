# Design Guidelines for Student Productivity PWA

## Design Approach
**Selected Framework**: Material Design principles adapted for productivity
**Rationale**: Information-dense student productivity app requiring clarity, consistency, and efficient data visualization. The app prioritizes usability and data comprehension over decorative elements.

## Core Design Principles
1. **Clarity First**: Every UI element serves a functional purpose
2. **Data Visibility**: Information hierarchy guides users to critical metrics (grades, upcoming exams, habit streaks)
3. **Theme Integration**: Selected palette colors distributed throughout UI, not relegated to accents only
4. **Mobile-First Responsive**: Bottom navigation for mobile, sidebar for desktop
